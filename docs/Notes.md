### PK/PD Data

- Compared to Genomics, which has broadly accepted formats due to the nature of sequencing data, PK/PD data can be more varied, consisting of concentration-time profiles, dose-response data, demographic information, etc. Hence, the formats can be more varied and tailored to specific software packages or analysis methods.
    
     - Focus on the following data formats:
        - [Pharmacokinetic Data Standards Consortium (PKDSC)](https://www.pkdatashare.com/standards/): Standardized data format for sharing PK/PD data.
        
        - [PharmML](https://www.pharmml.org/): XML-based markup language for storing pharmacometric models.
        
        - [SBML](http://sbml.org/): XML-based markup language for storing biochemical networks.
        
        - [SBGN](http://sbgn.org/): XML-based markup language for storing biochemical networks.
