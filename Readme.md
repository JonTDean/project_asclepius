## Overview

The PK/PD Data Visualization & Analysis Platform is designed for bio companies to facilitate in-depth analysis of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data. With integrated real-time collaboration features, researchers and analysts can work synchronously, ensuring seamless data interpretation and faster decision-making. The platform supports both gRPC and GraphQL to accommodate various data access and manipulation needs.

# Navigate to directory
cd project_asclepius

# Install dependencies and setup
... [other necessary commands]
```

## Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- **NextJS:** 
  - **Modern React Framework:** Built atop React, NextJS offers server-side rendering and static site generation, ensuring faster page loadsâ€”a crucial feature for data-intensive applications.
  - **API Routes:** An API-first approach allows developers to create dedicated API routes within the application with ease.
  - **Built-in CSS & SASS Support:** This integration streamlines the styling process, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing user interface.
  - **Fast Refresh:** A feature ensuring rapid development by instantly refreshing upon code changes without losing the component's state.

### Backend:
- **Rust:** 
  - **Safety & Performance:** Rust, a systems programming language, offers memory safety without sacrificing performance, ensuring a robust and efficient backend service.
  - **Concurrency Management:** The ownership model in Rust prevents data races, making it apt for concurrent processingâ€”a necessity for real-time data handling.
  - **Ecosystem:** The Cargo package manager and a growing library set provide Rust with the necessary tools for swift backend development.
- **Go & Fiber:** 
  - **Performance:** Go, a statically typed, compiled language, boasts of impressive performance, apt for real-time operations.
  - **Concurrency:** Goroutines in Go ensure efficient concurrent processing, crucial for managing multiple real-time collaboration sessions.
  - **Fiber Framework:** Built on Fasthttp, Fiber is designed for creating web applications with optimal performance.

### Database Systems:
- **Rust Visualization Database with GraphQL:** 
  - **Flexible Querying:** GraphQL enables clients to request only required data, thus reducing over-fetching and under-fetching.
  - **Strongly Typed Schema:** This feature ensures data consistency and validation.
  - **Real-time Subscriptions:** With GraphQL subscriptions, users receive real-time updates when data changes.
- **Rust Authorization Database & Go Collaboration Database with gRPC:** 
  - **Efficient Data Streaming:** Built atop HTTP/2, gRPC provides bi-directional streaming, facilitating real-time data communication.
  - **Protocol Buffers:** Serving as the interface definition language, it ensures efficient serialization of structured data.

### Protocols:
- **gRPC:** 
  - **Language Agnostic:** Supporting multiple programming languages, gRPC ensures seamless communication between different stack components.
  - **Deadlines/Timeouts:** Clients can specify their waiting duration for an RPC to complete. Servers can check this to decide if they should complete or abort operations that might take longer.
- **GraphQL:** 
  - **Declarative Data Fetching:** Clients can determine the exact data they need, reducing network data transfers.
  - **Strongly Typed:** Ensures data consistency and validationâ€”vital for dependable data visualization and analysis.

### Authorization:
- **Next Generation Access Control (NGAC):** 
  - **Fine-grained Access Control:** Unlike traditional models, NGAC provides detailed and contextual access control. Users can only access data they're authorized to view.
  - **Policy-based:** NGAC, being policy-centric, offers more flexibility in defining access rules compared to the role-centric RBAC.
  - **Dynamic Attributes:** NGAC can utilize dynamic attributes (like time of day, location, etc.) in its access decisions.


## Future Milestones

- **Enhanced Collaboration Features:** Introduce document sharing, whiteboarding, and annotation functionalities.
- **Advanced Data Analysis Tools:** Incorporate AI-driven insights for PK/PD data interpretation.
- **User Profiles and Customization:** Allow users to customize their dashboard, save visualization templates, and set preferences.
- **Integration with External Data Sources:** Facilitate data import from popular bio-analysis tools and platforms.
- **Mobile Support:** Develop a responsive design or mobile application for on-the-go access.
- **API Development:** Offer public APIs for third-party integrations and extensions.
